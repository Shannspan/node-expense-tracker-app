# node-expense-tracker-app
CLG Node JS Final Project

*   Install the pre-built front-end application

*   Fill the gaps to resolve errors

*   Run the front end with your Node.js server and local database (MonDB Compass)

*   Run tests to have maximum coverage 

*   Push application to GitHub

*   Extension work completed:

    *   Node.js server deployed on render

        *   https://node-expense-tracker-app-v2.onrender.com

    *   React.js app deployed on netlify

        *   https://react-expense-tracker-app-v2.netlify.app/

        *   https://github.com/Shannspan/react-expense-tracker-app-v2

    *   Move to MongoDB Atlas (cloud) for database

        *   https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/63b90585cafb0f15303e2f28#/clusters/detail/MyExpenseTracker

* Ideas for future development: 

    *   Tests are internal so far create separate files for Unit Testing

    *   React app is not responsive - make it mobile friendly

    *   Other functionality is in the code, add buttons so it can be used

    *   Find source of date formatting and change to DD/MM/YYYY - has been attempted but not successful so far
