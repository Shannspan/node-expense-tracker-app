CLG Node JS Final Project

*** Requesting assistance: 

*   I can now get localhost 3000 to display

*   on localhost 3000 the database link works but takes me to records created by the React front end NOT the MongoDB Atlas cluster

*   I have attempted new code on db.js but it does not work and also creates new errors

* So far I have used a few different resources including vscode suggestions, Mongo DB Atlas homepage  connection advice and an article from hevodata.com
