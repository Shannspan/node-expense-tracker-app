CLG Node JS Final Project

*** Requesting assistance: 

*   I can now get localhost 3000 to display

*   on localhost 3000 the database link works but takes me to records created by the React front end NOT the MongoDB Atlas cluster

*   New code on db.js now demonstrates Atlas connection to Node.js

*   The data from Atlas is no getting to Port 3000 (Node), or Port 3001 (React). The data is not flowing the opposite way either.

* So far I have used a few different resources including vscode suggestions, Mongo DB Atlas homepage  connection advice and an article from hevodata.com
